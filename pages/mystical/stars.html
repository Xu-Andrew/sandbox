    On stars<br />
    <br />
    “Those flickering lights,”<br />
    “The stars.”<br />
    “Yes, the stars. Do they ever get closer?”<br />
    “Well, do you see that one?” the magician pointed toward the heavens. “That’s Altair, from the Aquila constellation. That one is Deneb, from the Cygnus constellation. And there’s Vega, which is part of Lyra. These three make up the Summer Triangle.”<br />
    “All of the other stars seem to get along so well with each other. Why is the sun so far away?”<br />
    “In reality, those stars seem close, but they are really far apart. They are part of the same triangle, but they are light years away from each other.”<br />
    “How will I ever visit all of them if they are all so far apart,” wondered the boy in dismay.<br />
    “However, you are closer to them than you think,” the magician replied. “Those stars out there are not so different from ours. If you understand the Sun, perhaps you can understand them.”<br />
    “Perhaps.”<br />
    “...”<br />
    “...”<br />
    “I think it’s time for us to get off of the Moon.”<br />
