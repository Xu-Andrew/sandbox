    ;;Courage is sitting on the edge of the roof, leaning on his right arm which is<br />
    ;;stiff and vertical and holding the edge of the roof with his right hand. His left<br />
    ;;arm is bent and his left elbow rests on his left leg while his left hand lightly<br />
    ;;holds a pair of binoculars which is strung around his neck with some string.<br />
    ;;His left foot rests on the edge of the roof. His right leg hangs over the roof.<br />
    ;;He doesn’t hold the binoculars too closely to his eyes, but uses them as if he is<br />
    ;;examining the binoculars themselves. Beside his right hand is an open notepad and<br />
    ;;a pencil. Above him are countless stars from the Milky Way galaxy.<br />
    On shooting stars<br />
    <br />
    “Courage!”<br />
    “Yes?” came a soft reply from somewhere.<br />
    She turned around to see Courage on the rooftop. Courage momentarily tilted his head down from the stars to look at her.<br />
    “What are you doing up there?”<br />
    “The sky is full of shooting stars tonight,” said Courage. “I don’t have enough wishes to use them all right now so I’m saving the ones I can’t use. I’m writing down their transversal velocities and orthogonal projections to find them again when I need them.”<br />
    A bright light shot through the sky and lit up the heavens for a fleeting moment.
