    On to the sun<br />
    <br />
    North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, announced at a conference in North Korea that they were planning on landing a man on the sun. The U.S. was the first to land a man on the moon, so North Korea would be the first to go one step further, proclaimed Kim Jong Un. Immediately, a reporter asked him “the sun is so hot, how do you plan on sending a man there?”. The room fell silent. Kim Jong Un thought for a second and then replied “we will go when it’s nighttime!” and the room roared with applause. Upon seeing this broadcast on live television in a room with his fellow politicians, United States President Obama laughed and exclaimed “that idiot! There is no sun at night!” and the room roared with laughter.
