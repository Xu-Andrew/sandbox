    On small things<br />
    <br />
    A few days back I had a conversation with a ballerina. She told me that she had, on New Year’s Eve, performed for a couple and not spent the day with her family. I asked her about why she’d done it for only a couple of people and that too on such a day (I had known her long enough to know that it wasn’t about money). How could such a small thing attract her? She told me, “There are no small things”. Yesterday, I found out from a mutual friend that the couple were celebrating their 48th and last anniversary. The husband had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and had less than a year to live. She had performed for them because they had contacted her with their story. They wanted to relive the experience from their 1st anniversary. So it got me wondering. Are there any small things? - Sayan Sen
