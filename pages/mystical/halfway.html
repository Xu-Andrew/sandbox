    Zeno once said that if an arrow were to be shot at him, it would never reach him. To get to him, the arrow would first have to get to the halfway point between where it was fired and where his body was. To continue onwards, it must reach the halfway point between the halfway point and him. It must then pass halfway through the remaining distance to him and himself. Since there are an infinite number of halfways between the arrow and him, he claimed that the arrow would never reach him. So they shot an arrow at him. Turns out, he was only half right.
