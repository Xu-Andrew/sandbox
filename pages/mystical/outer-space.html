    “But there is no oxygen in space,” said Courage. “How will we breathe?”<br />
    The magician handed him a small metal box. “Hold this,” he said.<br />
    “What is it?” inquired the boy.<br />
    “It’s your breath,” replied the magician.<br />
    Courage held the box tightly. His feet were lifted up from the ground before they were ready to part with the earth. He felt his balance falling into a precarious state. His body swung upside-down as he climbed above the clouds.<br />
    “I’m upside-down!” shouted Courage.<br />
    “There is no upside-down in space!” laughed the magician.<br />
    The two broke through the clouds and climbed higher still. The air around them began to thin as they got lighter and lighter until the sky was a pool of blue below them. At last, they were in space.<br />
    “Hold your breath!” said the magician.<br />
    “What?” replied Courage.<br />
    “Isn’t it beautiful?” said the magician. “Look, there is the sun. It’s still burning. And there is the moon. It’s still shining. No matter the time of day or night, you can see anything if you climb high enough. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention that there’s no sound in space.”<br />
    “I can’t hear you,” said the boy. “There’s no sound in space.”<br />
    “Anyway, come along now. This way,” the magician gestured for Courage to follow.<br />
    The two headed towards the moon.
