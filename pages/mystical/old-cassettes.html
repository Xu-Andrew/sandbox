    Good morning me<br />
    Did you sleep well?<br />
    Did you wake up feeling good?<br />
    Did the light and the wind and the smell and the sound all seem like they’re brand new and fresh this morning?<br />
    Is each and every cell in your whole body awake and alive now?<br />
    Today, you are who you are today. See? You’re still me, but you’re a newer version.<br />
    <br />
    Myself ten years from now. That’s so far away it’s almost impossible to imagine. Am I alone or is there a wonderful person next to me?
